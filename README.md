# React Hooks
- Functions those are responsible for state updates, uodate monitoring, and returning the latest state to component so that component can render
    - useState()
        - defining and mutating state
    - useEffect()
        - Handles lifecycle for component i.e. mounting and unmounting and perform state updates
        - Manages the heavy-load operations e.g. AJAX Calls
    - useContext()
        - Effective way of sharing state across components with parent-child relationship
        - React.createContext()
            - Create a Global map to store data that can be passed across the components using following
                - Provider
                    - The component that uses 'context' to pass 'Object' to its children (precisly specific child ata a time)
                    - Object
                        - a literal {}
                            - this can have 'one' property or 'property' and 'callback'
                - Comsumer
                    - The component that subscribes to the 'context' using 'useContext()' to read values as well as link with the callback, if exist
    - useRef()
        - Associated with state but does not re-render the DOM
    - useReducer()
        - Used for implementing State update in transition
            - INITIAL_STATE
            - PROCESSING_STATE
            - FINAL_STATE
    - useCallback()
        - used to return the memoized callback function
        - Caching
    - useMemo()
        - Actualy a cache value     
    
# Practices
- Make sure that, if the multiple components have similar UI with change in data, then create a re-usable component and use it as a child across various components    
- Guidelines for re-usable components
    - Use the Standard HTML UI
    - Plan for Data properties those will accept data from its parent
    - Plan for callbacks to emit data from child to parent component
