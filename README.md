# React Hooks
- Functions those are responsible for state updates, uodate monitoring, and returning the latest state to component so that component can render
    - useState()
        - defining and mutating state
    - useEffect()
        - Handles lifecycle for component i.e. mounting and unmounting and perform state updates
        - Manages the heavy-load operations e.g. AJAX Calls
        - useEffect(componentMountCallback return comoponentWillUnMountCallBack, DEPENDENCY-PARAMETER);
            - componentMountCallback
                - This will be executed after the component is rendered (SHOW HTML in Browser)
                - Write Heavy-Logic here  e.g. AJAX call
                - If this logic (e.g. AJAX call) updates the state property, this will update the DOM again i.e. rendering
                - Since useEffect () will continue executing, this will udpate state again-an-again and hence cost the rendering
                - Use the dependency parameter to inform the useEffect() that the state is already updates and hence ueEffect() execution can stop 
            - comoponentWillUnMountCallBack
                - This will be executed when the Component is removed from DOM i.e. Browser's UI Thread
                - Write the following type of code
                    - Relese Promise Subscription
                    - Relese Windows Events if any
                        - e.g.
                            - MouseMove
                            - Keyboard events
                    - Clean states if any    
    - useContext()
        - Effective way of sharing state across components with parent-child relationship
        - React.createContext()
            - Create a Global map to store data that can be passed across the components using following
                - Provider
                    - The component that uses 'context' to pass 'Object' to its children (precisly specific child ata a time)
                    - Object
                        - a literal {}
                            - this can have 'one' property or 'property' and 'callback'
                - Comsumer
                    - The component that subscribes to the 'context' using 'useContext()' to read values as well as link with the callback, if exist
    - useRef()
        - Associated with state but does not re-render the DOM
        - Prevent the Current Component from UnNecessary Re-Rendering
    - useReducer()
        - Used for implementing State update in transition
            - INITIAL_STATE
            - PROCESSING_STATE
            - FINAL_STATE
    - useCallback()
        - used to return the memoized callback function
        - Caching
        - Execute the function / logic from child in the Parent Component and hence pass the updated value from Parent to Child
    - useMemo()
        - Actualy a cache value  
        - Cache resule of the Complex Function is it exist in the Component   
    
- Use either 'fetch()' object from ES 6 OR use 'axios' library package (Recommended)
    - Http Calls to External APIs
    - They are 'Promise' based objects    


# React Boundaries
- No inbuilt validations exists
    - formik and yup
        - Additional JS libraries can be used for form management
    - Use HTML 5 Validation Support
    - Write explict domain validations (recommended)
- Routing
    - Single Page App (SPA)     
    - React-Router
        - React-Router-DOM
- Lack of Framework Feature Support in react
    -  Think of using 'Next.js' for it
    - React Framework
        - by Vercel
        - Manage Lifecycle of React Component with following
            - Routing
            - Server Side Rendering
            - Dynamic Routes
            - Inbuilt Suppoirt for API
            - Authorization                
# Practices
- Make sure that, if the multiple components have similar UI with change in data, then create a re-usable component and use it as a child across various components    
- Guidelines for re-usable components
    - Use the Standard HTML UI
    - Plan for Data properties those will accept data from its parent
    - Plan for callbacks to emit data from child to parent component
- Make sure that create an ErrorBundary component
    - This will be a class component derived from 'Component' base class
    - This component will implement following two methods
        - 'getDerivedStateFromError()'
            - this is a static method that will listen to the props/state changes from  the child componemt and if there us an error it will trigger following method
        - componentDidCatch
            - This will display error message
            - Then the fallback rendering will be executed
- Lazyloading
    - The 'Suspense'
        - The Component (ExoticComponent), used for tracking the component loading if the component being load is taking time
        - Till the component is not loaded, the fallbackUI will be shown in UI tree
    - The 'React.lazy()'
        - The function that loads the component based on import URL                          
- React-Router-DOM
    - BrowserRouter
        - Container COmponent under which the routing will takes place
    - Routes
        - Defining the Route Paths aka Table
        - Collection of 'Route'
        - The 'path', the URI
        - The 'element', the component         
        - The 'index' propert, that represents the default component that will be rendered   
    - Outlet
        - The Container Compone that will render component when it is requested
    - Link
        -  Used to query the route table for navigation
        - The 'to' property taht will be used for navigation  
    - useNavigation() hook
        - THis will be used to provode navigation in routing
    - useParams() hook
        - This is used to read the current route parameter
